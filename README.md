# Infinity_mirror
An ESP8266 powered infinity mirror with WS2812B RGBLEDs and an 0.96" OLED

## Concept:
Using stuff from a box of salvaged components, a damaged 0.96" I2C OLED screen and some one way mirror film build an infinity mirror that looks like it fell out of a 90's SciFi film.

- 0.96" OLED
- WS2812B RGBLEDs
- Perf board (the cheap stuff from Amazon)
- Random components that sort of look cool
